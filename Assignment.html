	<p>“Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them
with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god.
Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them
with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion
that they are gods.”</p>
